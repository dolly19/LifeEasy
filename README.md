Home Robot: a household cleaner integrated with a home automation system.

PIS Major Project

Problem Statement - Your in-house party was a great success, and your friends and family all had a wonderful time. So far, so good. But what happens in the morning? You wake up to a whole big mess and need to tackle it. It is a very tedious task for the organizer to clean the space. This cleaning job requires a lot of manpower and your complete day wasted in such a trivial task.

We designed a circuit using Arduino, which counts the number of persons inside the room and when the count would be zero, an obstacle-avoiding self-cleaning bot will be activated. The robot avoids obstacles and sweeps the floor.
